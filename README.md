# World Cup 2022 Novelty Flag Spinner

This was a desktop application I made for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, inspired by the cover of Panini's sticker album for the tournament. A user can see the flags of the 32 teams in the tournament and make them spin by placing the cursor over it.

The application is made with Windows Presentation Foundation (XAML and C#).

# Issues

- The spinning animmations will restart if the cursor is no longer touching a flag and touches it again before it finishes, making it look like it's clipping.
- The flags are compressed to be 50px wide, meaning some of them look pixelated and less detailed.

# Extra features
- Extra novelties I might have added include the ability to make flags spin indefinitely and adjust the speed of the animation.
- If I connected the app to a World Cup API, I'd allow users to see results of a team's matches if they click on their respective flag.
